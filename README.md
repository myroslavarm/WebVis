# WebVis
project for the web dev class

> LATEST UPDATE
Index page is complete, the respective word clouds are still WIP.

In this project I'll be making a visualisation on the topic of elections. This visualisation has to be interactive and made with d3.js. The scrips for processing the data for this visualisation will also be written in JavaScript.

### Project stages

This project is split into the following stages:

1. Preparation
2. Research
3. Data parsing
4. Making the visualisation
5. Finishing up the final details and documentation

### Plan for realisation

**In #1 I will:**

1. configure the environment and all the things I need for further development
2. research more about how d3.js works, as I've never used it
3. look more into SVG layouts, and try making some basic things with d3.js

**In #2 I will:**

1. look for a dataset that fits my criteria for this project
2. see how to do data parsing and processing in JavaScript
3. come up with a clear idea of what part of the dataset I want to focus on

**In #3 I will:**

1. create a JavaScript parser based on examples I've researched
2. clean the data / get rid of stuff I don't need
3. fully prepare the data in any way that is necessary for the visualisation step

**In #4 I will:**

1. make the layouts for how my visualisation should look like
2. visualise the dataset I prepared
3. implement the script that makes it interactive

**In #5 I will:**

1. make sure the code is clean and that everything works well
2. update the documentation
3. publish the final result that is a nice d3.js visualisation

### Goal of the project

Is to have a cool political visualisation that is made using only d3.js.

By the 2nd working period (August, 25) I will have the first 3 stages done (preparation, research, and data parsing). Hopefully at that time the 4th stage (visualisation itself) will also be already in progress.
